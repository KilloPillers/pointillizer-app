# Dotillism.io

Dotillism.io is a web application that transforms your images (JPEG or PNG) into stunning pointillism/dotillism representations. Utilizing various point generation algorithms, Dotillism.io offers a unique and customizable way to create dot art.

## Features

Dotillism.io comes with several powerful point generation algorithms:

- **Poisson Disc Sampling**
- **Adaptive Poisson Disc Sampling with Greyscale Density**
- **Fibonacci Sunflower Spiral**
- **Grid**

Each generator includes settings that allow you to fine-tune the final pointillism image, including:

- Minimum and maximum dot radii
- Fill percentage
- Invert grayscale
- K-value for Poisson disc sampling algorithms
- Recursive mode

There are additional options specific to each generator that you can explore to achieve your desired effect.

## Getting Started

### Steps to Create a Pointillism Image

1. **Select a Photo**: Upload your JPEG or PNG image.
2. **Select a Generator**: Choose one of the available generators to use.
3. **Start the Generator**: Customize the settings and generate your pointillism image.

### Saving Your Artwork

Once you have generated an image, you can save it as a PNG or SVG file.

## Important Notes

- **Image Size**: For optimal performance, keep your image size small. The runtime of the generators depends on the number of pixels in the image. Future updates will include an auto-resize feature for large images to enhance efficiency.
